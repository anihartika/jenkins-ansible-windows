Below are the workarounds I found for the respective errors 

DBT-06208:password you specified for SYS, SYSTEM or PDBADMIN does not comply with the recommended password complexity, you can either use a stronger one or just ignore it.

the error might be thrown during database creation in silent mode.

So we cna ignore this error 

Next ORA-27104 and ORA-01034:

Kernel parameter shmall is set to 2097152 as documented in http://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/db112/LADBI/pre_install.htm#LADBI1187
Oracle Support Web mentions document Doc ID 1922934.1 with Bug 14202016 (LNX64-12.1-BC:DBCA FAILED TO CREATE POLICY DB DUE TO ORA-27104). A one-off patch can be demanded or as a workaround shmall can be increased to 9272480:
The following command sets the change immediately
sysctl -w kernel.shmall=9272480
Additionally, it is necessary to make the changes persistent in files like /etc/sysctl.conf (or better in a separate file that is also loaded during reboot) with an entry
kernel.shmall=9272480
